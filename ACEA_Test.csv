The Ohio Nurse Practice Act,Course #31372,$15 ,1 Hour/Credit,"Nurses in Ohio are legally bound to ""practice in accordance with acceptable and
        prevailing standards of safe nursing care."" This course will acquaint nurses with the basics
        of the Ohio Revised Code, which is the legal parameter for evaluating and disciplining
        nurses within this State. The Board and Legislature use national practice standards,
        current, nationally recognized periodicals, and professional expertise to update or modify
        Ohio Code. The Board evaluates reported deviation from standards with relation to intent,
        pattern and circumstance. After the evaluation of the violation a nurse is adjudicated
        through due process action. The board may revoke or place restrictions on the nurse's
        license, reprimand, and levy a fine or take no action when standards have been breached with
        regard to competent practice, nursing process, patient safety, or delegation of duty. Thus,
        it becomes the prudent practice for each Ohio nurse to become familiar with the basic
        standards which govern the major areas of practice.","This continuing nursing education activity was approved by the Ohio
