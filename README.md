# ACEA_Data_Scraping_Test
I created a categories list that held all of the headers(i.e. categories) of the example course page. I then created multiple lists
and variable to create the entries within those categories. Although I would have liked to make this part more standarized, the html of the page
was rather strangely constructed.
